Submitted by: **Christopher Ketant**

Time spent: **10** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

The following **optional** features are implemented:

## Notes

### Challenges

The hardest challenge to overcome was translating my understanding of the iOS cocoa framework from an Objective-c context to Swift. I constantly found myself knowing what I want to do
and how to do it but unable to translate it to implementation since I do not know Swift. The new Xcode 8 was also a bit challenging due to the new updates for example the changes done to the Storyboard
functionality.
